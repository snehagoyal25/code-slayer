# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Input
- Two strings, s and t.

### Output
- A boolean indicating whether t is an anagram of s.

### Example

**Input:**
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"

**Output:**
true

### Constraints
- The input strings consist of lowercase English letters.
- The lengths of both strings are in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
