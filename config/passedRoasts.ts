	"Wow, you actually did it! Miracles do happen—next, you'll claim you can cook!",
	"Well, that took longer than expected. Did you consult a magic eight ball or just pray?",
	"Impressive! I didn’t think you’d pull it off. Did you bribe the compiler with pizza?",
	"Not bad! It only took you 10 tries. Consistency is key, even if it's consistent failure!",
	"You solved it! What’s next, figuring out how to turn on the monitor?",
	"You cracked that like an egg! Too bad it was rotten—just like your logic.",
	"Look at you, writing code that actually works! Did you finally let the computer have a say?",
	"Finally, a solution that won’t make the computer throw itself out the window.",
	"Well done! I was about to call in the coding SWAT team to rescue your disaster.",
	"Great job! If only your life decisions were this effective—oh wait, they’re not!",
	"Congrats on finally stumbling into a solution! Maybe next time you’ll stumble into a good idea.",
	"Did you finally read the problem statement? I'm shocked, really!",
	"Who knew you had it in you? Must be those late-night caffeine binges paying off.",
	"Well, look at you! A coding legend in the making... for all the wrong reasons.",
	"You’ve finally solved it! Now let’s hope the next one doesn’t take an eternity.",
	"You should consider a career in archaeology—digging up old mistakes is your specialty!",
	"I didn’t think you’d make it, but here we are! Just don’t expect a round of applause; more like a snicker.",
	"You should get a trophy for persistence... or a participation award, if we're being generous!",
	"Look at you, defying all odds! What’s next, trying to fix your social skills?",
	"You turned that error into success! If only you could do the same with your social life.",
	"You did it! I can almost hear the cheers from your imaginary friends. They must be thrilled!",
	"You’ve made it! Now, let’s see if your next challenge is as easy… spoiler: it won’t be!",
	"I didn’t think you could pull it off, but you’ve clearly outsmarted... well, nobody really.",
	"Well done! You’ve managed to code something that’s slightly less of a dumpster fire.",
	"You should give lessons on how to almost solve a problem—your expertise in near-success is impressive!",
	"That code was like a blind date—awkward, painful, and nobody's really sure how it worked out.",
	"I’m shocked! Did you finally discover that ‘read the documentation’ is a thing? Bravo!",
	"Congratulations! You’ve proven that even a stopped clock is right twice a day... too bad you’re not one of those times.",
	"You’ve unlocked the secret achievement: ‘The Last-Minute Savior’! Now, if only it paid the bills.",
	"Bravo! You’ve turned the impossible into something slightly less embarrassing—what an achievement!",
	"I can’t believe you did it! Now just remember, less is more... except when it comes to your mistakes.",
	"You’ve become a coding legend! At least in your own mind, where the code is flawless.",
	"You cracked the code! Now let’s hope you don’t break it again—again!",
	"Well, at least your code didn’t self-destruct this time! We’re all impressed… sort of.",
	"Congratulations! You made it through the maze of confusion with your sanity barely intact."
